# Code style and generation rules

Use these rules whenever generating or editing code in this repository.

---

## 1) Comments

- Prefer **short and objective comments**.
- Only add comments when they add real value (context, intent, caveats).
- Do not repeat what the code already makes obvious.
- Start comments with **lowercase** and keep them concise.
- Avoid filling files with commentary; prioritize clear code instead of explanations.

---

## 2) Naming and language

- All identifiers and code elements should be in **English**.
- Use names that are **descriptive but not verbose**.
- Default conventions:
  - Variables: `lowerCamelCase`
  - Functions and methods: `lowerCamelCase`
  - Files: `kebab-case` or `snake_case`, always starting with lowercase
- In general, **names should start with a lowercase letter**, including functions, variables and files.
- Avoid abbreviations that are not obvious; prefer clarity.

---

## 3) Code structure and style

- Prefer **simple and direct solutions** over complex abstractions.
- Remove unused code, dead branches and commented out blocks.
- Keep functions focused:
  - One main responsibility per function when possible.
- Formatting:
  - Keep indentation, spacing and line breaks consistent with the existing style of the file.
- When refactoring, keep changes as **local and incremental** as possible, instead of rewriting everything.

---

## 4) Documentation and extra files

- Do **not** automatically generate `.md` files to explain what was changed.
- Changelogs, summaries or extra documentation in Markdown should only be created **if the user explicitly asks for it**.
- When explaining changes, prefer:
  - Inline comments (only when necessary).
  - Short explanations in the assistant message itself, not as new files.

---

## 5) Interaction with the user

- Before introducing new patterns or structures, try to **follow the existing style** in the repo.
- When there is more than one reasonable approach:
  - Choose the simplest one.
  - If needed, briefly mention alternatives in the conversation, but do not generate extra code files for them.
